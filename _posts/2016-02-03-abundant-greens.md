"I rose from marsh mud

algae, equisetum, willows,

sweet green, noisy

birds and frogs." - Lorine Niedecker 

From where I come,

so must I return,

but until I succumb,

neither rest nor adjourn.

Frustrated,

and about to quit;

that's when you'll see

the path that's lit.

Beckoning its illumined fall,

now you can not ignore its call.

Your long crusade

finds willing support.

Never afraid

to come up short.

There; laying before you,

are the ways and means,

and without further ado,

all of the abundant greens.
