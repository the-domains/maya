I have noticed, since just a pup

there seems always to be,

bright colors popup.

All around her head, as she sits and smiles,

blue, green purple and red, so many shapes and styles.

A beautiful rainbow, that's what I see.

Sometimes more yellow, its as sweet as can be.

I know we all have one, it comes from within,

while playing in the sun, you can't help but grin.

But Maya's rainbow glows, it glows, and it grows,

with both highs and lows, up and down her nose.

It shoots from her eyes, way up to the skies.

Up, up so high, as if they could fly.

Just remember to think, some wonderful things.

Close your eyes and blink to give your thoughts their wings.

A rainbow will form, and the colors within,

will make you feel warm, down deep under your skin.

That's what Maya said, and she ought to know.

Green, blue, orange and red, yellow violet and Indigo.

all the beautiful colors of the rainbow.... 

Maya says you have a rainbow too..
