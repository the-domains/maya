"Dive into your heart center. Sit in the silence. Desire self-realization with all your heart, with all your mind, and all your soul. Everything will take care of itself." - Robert Adams 

Is there anything 

more beautiful 

than a dream, 

that is well expressed, 

and becoming? 

Its a magical quest, 

with reality succumbing 

to an effortless molding 

and the present 

so perfectly unfolding?
