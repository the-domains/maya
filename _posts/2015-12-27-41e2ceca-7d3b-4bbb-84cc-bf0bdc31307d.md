It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear. - Francis Bacon

Its divine fashion

Articulated in

divine fashion,

first,

live in desire,

until 

your passion 

catches fire.

Then, 

spare no ration,

merely live 

that inspired desire.

And,

if you falter

worry not,

just return and alter 

to the love you forgot.
