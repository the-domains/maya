It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear. - Francis Bacon

_Articulated in  
divine fashion,  
first,  
live in desire,  
until   
your passion   
catches fire.  
Then,   
spare no ration,  
merely live   
that inspired desire.  
And,  
if you falter  
worry not,  
just return and alter   
to the love you forgot._
