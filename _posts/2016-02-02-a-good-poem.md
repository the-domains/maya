  “A good poem is a contribution to reality. The world is never the same once a
  good poem has been added to it. A good poem helps to change the shape of the
  universe, helps to extend everyone's knowledge of himself and the world around
  him.” Dylan Thomas.

Isn't my story,

also your story?

And our rhyme,

just keeping time

with the cosmic clock; 

a kindof

harmonic tick-tock?

With my heart and mind,

so intimately weaved,

may I go beyond

whats ever been achieved?

Are our stories the sources,

causing our ends to remold?

Sets in motion unstoppable forces,

and like words and pictures unfold.
