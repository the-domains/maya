Isn't my story,

also your story?

And our rhyme,

just keeping time

with the cosmic clock; 

a kindof

harmonic tick-tock?

With my heart and mind,

so intimately weaved,

may I go beyond

whats ever been achieved?

Are our stories the sources,

causing our ends to remold?

Sets in motion unstoppable forces,

and like words and pictures unfold.
