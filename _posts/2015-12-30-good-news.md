The bad news is nothing lasts forever,
The good news is nothing lasts forever. - J. Cole.

Feeling mighty fine,
good news arrived. 

Naysay all that I may 
but it's just a shuck n jive. 

You know, all that
distracting talk 

and meaningless
chitter-chatter-squawk. 

I think I'll keep swimming, 

in the substance of dreams.

My good fortune's brimming, 

my cup runneth over it seems.
