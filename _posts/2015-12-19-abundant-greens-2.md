  In all of creation
  there are many scenes.
  But to me, none as moving
  as summer's abundant greens. 

  Among them, 
  everywhere I look
  a greenish hue 
  washes my view.

  The countless
  many leaves
  on the bush
  or in the trees     
  or blades of grass,
  soft clumps of moss,
  and other greens amass.

  Why is life so eager to live?
  (as variants of summer's green show.)
  The nature of this descriptive infinitive,
  is expansion into infinity, don't you know.
