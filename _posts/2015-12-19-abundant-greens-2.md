Abundant greens 2

In all of creation
there are many scenes.
But to me, none as moving
as summer's abundant greens. 
Among them, 
everywhere I look
a greenish hue 
washes my view.
The countless
many leaves
on the bush
or in the trees 
or blades of grass,
soft clumps of moss,
and other greens amass.
Why is life so eager to live?
(as variants of summer's green show.)
The nature of this descriptive infinitive,
is expansion into infinity, don't you know.
