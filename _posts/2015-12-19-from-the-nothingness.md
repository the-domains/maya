From 
the nothingness 
that I come,
I return, 
and in my blindness, 
I see myself become
what it is I yearn.
Flashing;
in and out,
I dare, 
to travel 
from here to nowhere,
I move at a substantial rate,
determining my adventure,
my experience, my very fate. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b173aaedaab4e772c69839f25ed50296d2672567.jpg)
