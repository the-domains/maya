From 
the nothingness 
that I come, 

I return, 
and in my blindness, 

I see myself become 

what it is I yearn. 

Flashing;
in and out, 

I dare, 
to travel 
from here to nowhere, 

I move at a substantial rate, 

determining my adventure, 

my experience, my very fate. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b173aaedaab4e772c69839f25ed50296d2672567.jpg)
