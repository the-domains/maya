So many ways

to express how I see,

but always through

the filters in me

In words and pictures,

in music and dance,

in sports and studies,

in games of chance.

It can cause real trouble,

if I choose to judge,

my opinions, in a bubble,

so firm I won't budge.

It can cause a grace,

if instead, I choose love,

and expressing this face, 

brings heaven from above.

Everything that we do is a creation,

and everything we say, a vibration.

So what creative juices light your fire

what things can you now do,

to help lift us all from the mire.
