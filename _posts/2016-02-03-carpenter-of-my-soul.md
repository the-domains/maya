Every moment I shape my destiny with a chisel - I am the carpenter of my own soul. - Rumi 

We are like clay

molded to shape

etched in delay

and repaired with duct tape.

If I can remain true

to my spirit view,

constantly aware,

with everything bare,

then with each moment

I become more potent.

I am and I will be

all I imagine in me.
