![Stay in that place](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f9f9346e-f728-4d41-afd2-7bf5bca1f2f1.jpg)

Stay;

be in this place of wonder,

where everything I see

is just for me.

Where rain and thunder

bring,

such a grand energy

to all the grasses

and open fields.

There,

water amasses,

until its power wields

all of life to expand,

right on queue,

and at my command.
