I was out for a walk

with my dog,

when I came upon

a very big frog.

He was the biggest frog

I'd ever seen,

and although only

a little green,

he treated me to the

best greet that has ever been.

And when we went on our way,

from then on and everyday,

I was the best greeting machine

the world has ever seen.
